# RNAseq Tutorial

This repository provides a complete, step-by-step tutorial for performing RNA-seq data analysis using publicly available datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The dataset used in this project, GSE148036, contains RNA-seq profiles of lung adenocarcinoma tissues and adjacent healthy (normal) tissues obtained from human samples. The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to process, analyze, and interpret RNA-seq data in a reproducible manner, covering the entire workflow from raw FASTQ files to the identification of differentially expressed genes and downstream biological insights.

The dataset for this study includes two groups: adjacent healthy tissues and lung adenocarcinoma samples. The healthy tissue group comprises SRR11262284, SRR11262285, SRR11262286, and SRR11262287, representing normal lung tissue adjacent to tumor sites. The lung adenocarcinoma group includes SRR11262292, SRR11262293, SRR11262294, and SRR11262295, representing tumor tissues.
